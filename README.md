```
To build image yourself
```
  docker built -t android_cppdev_prerequisites .
```

To run, execute 

```
  docker run -p 5903:5903 -p 5901:5901 --privileged android_cppdev_prerequisites
```
Container then can be accessed via vnc connection ( password:123456 )
- option1: via browser http://localhost:5901/vnc.html  ( using noVNC )
- option2: any vncviewer on *localhost:3*

### running on real devices 

Its also possible to deploy c++ applications to real devices. There are rwo approaches

- running via shared USB
```
  docker run -p 5903:5903 -p 5901:5901 --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb <img> 
```

- running by running ADB on host ( requires same version platform-tools on host and starting adb on host first )
```
  docker run -p 5903:5903 -p 5901:5901 --privileged --network=host <img> 
```
